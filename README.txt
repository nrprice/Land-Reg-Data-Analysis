---- Information ----

This is an ongoing project and elements of the code and organisation of the notebooks and file structures are not finished.


Instructions

The Land Registry Data Analysis notebook can be run and will read the correct csv files, but will not give a full overview of the data due to file limits on individual files.
I have included smaller versions of the neccessary csv files in order to allow the notebook to run.

To fully make use of the notebook it is recommended to download the full land registry price paid and UK postcode information data.
They must be saved in the same directory as Land Registry Data Analysis.ipynb, and you should not modify the file name.
They have not been included in the GitHub Repository as they are too large. The price paid data is nearly 5GB.
